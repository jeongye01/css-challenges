            <p>
               Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling
               of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
               MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
               JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
               colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed]
               provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
               multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
               reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
               improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of
               formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
               different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
               reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
               is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
               determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular
               element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the
               World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS
               by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5] In
               addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
               CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.

            <p>
               CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[23] At the time, Lie was working with Tim
               Berners-Lee at CERN.[24] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same
               time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first
               W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was
               influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26] Style sheets have
               existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the
               1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[27] One requirement for a web style
               sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style
               sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be
               influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27] As HTML grew, it came to encompass
               a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the
               designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser
               implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[28] made consistent site appearance difficult, and
               users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim
               Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not
               be linked to documents on the web.[24] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure
               from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing,
               screen-based presentations, and editors.[28]

            <h3 class="target" id="overview4">Limitations</h3>
            <p>
               Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include: Cannot explicitly declare new scope
               independently of position Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent
               element with a position: absolute or position: relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired
               effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an
               element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element. Pseudo-class dynamic
               behavior not controllable CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by
               conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent of
               JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for misuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups),[67]
               but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no
               "nochange"-like values for each property). Cannot name rules There is no way to name a CSS rule, which
               would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes. Cannot
               include styles from a rule into another rule CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to
               achieve the desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing. Some new
               CSS features were proposed to solve this but were abandoned afterward.[68][69] Instead, authors may gain
               this ability by using more sophisticated stylesheet languages which compile to CSS, such as Sass, Less,
               or Stylus. Cannot target specific text without altering markup Besides the :first-letter pseudo-element,
               one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize placeholder elements.
